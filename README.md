Disconnect users of Windows sessions (RDP)

#started 

The server where you will disconnect users insert them config.json

If you have just run python Qrdp.py in cmd windows:
example: c: \ users \ myuser> python qrdp.py

If you can not disconnect a user of your server it is due to lack of permissions, run it with a user that has permission to disconnect a user.


if you do not run the qrdp.exe python file located in the qrdp.zip
confg.json set the file opens the executable with administrator permissions on the remote server.
